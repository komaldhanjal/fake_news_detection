# fake_news_detection

Fake News Detection is a Machine Learning–based project designed to identify whether a given news article is real or fake. With the rapid spread of misinformation on social media and digital platforms, this system helps in verifying the authenticity of news content using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The project uses text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and machine learning classifiers to analyze news articles and make accurate predictions. Users can input news text, and the model classifies it as Fake or Real based on learned patterns from the training data.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of NLP, ML algorithms, and Python, making it suitable for academic learning as well as real-world applications.
